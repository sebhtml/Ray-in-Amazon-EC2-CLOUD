Sample: SRA001125
URL: http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/submission?acc=SRA001125
DNA reads: 34911784 (2 * 17455892)
Read length (nt): 36
Technology: Illumina Genome Analyzer

Why use Ray?

1. It gives correct (excellent) results.
2. It's 0 $.
3. It's free software (freedom).
4. It runs on all the cores you give it.
5. It scales.
6. It's "cloud-ready".


API name: m1.large
Running time: 
Pricing: 0.260 $ / h
Cost: 

API name: m3.xlarge
Running time: 02:31:34
Pricing: 0.580 $ / h
Cost: 1.730 $

API name: cc2.8xlarge
Running time: 00:54:06
Pricing: 2.400 / h 
Cost: 2.400 $


Conclusions:

1. You get your results faster if you pay more.

2. For cc2.8xlarge, 33% (00:19:40) of the time was loading sequences from EBS.
That's a lot !

3. The scalability on this problem is not that good because the
problem size is not very large.

4. Amazon EC2 is really affordable for de novo assemblies of bacterial genomes.
